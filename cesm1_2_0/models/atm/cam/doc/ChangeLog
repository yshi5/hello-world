One-line Summary: cam release branch for cesm1_2_0


New features in CAM-5.3:
========================

. CAM-SE
  . Lagrangian vertical advection is now the default in the spectral
    element (SE) dynamical core.
  . Renamed HOMME dynamical core to SE dynamical core.  Moved dynamics/homme to 
    dynamics/se.  "-dyn homme" has been deprecated for configure, please use 
    "-dyn se" instead.  Note that HOMME (High Order Method Modeling
    Environment) refers to another model from which the SE dycore may also
    be run. 
  . New initial condition file for ne30np4 CAM5.
  . New tunings for ne16np4, ne30np4, and ne120np4.
  . Turned on energy fixer.
  . Rename references from "cslam" to "fvm".

. CARMA
  . New CARMA sulfate model flag "carma_do_hetchem" toggles the use of CARMA
    sulfate surface area density in heterogeneous chemistry rate calculations.
  . Source code updates for CARMA sulfate model to interact with chemistry.
  . Fix for meteor_smoke and pmc CARMA models with specified dynamics cases.
  . Use carma_do_thermo to prevent access of unallocated array in the "CRTT" 
    outfld call.
  . Change ptend names to differentiate between CARMA tendencies originating in 
    different routines.
  . Force internal calculations to use 365 day years, to deal with mismatches 
    between year lengths in CARMA and specified dynamics files.
  . Get CARMA working with debug flags turned on (Lahey, PGI, Intel).

. CLUBB
  . CLUBB was tuned for a scientifically validated release.
     . Introduced sol_facti_cloud_borne to allow tuning, default value is 1.0.
     . Changed tuning of dust_emis_fact_dyn for CLUBB.
     . Introduced ability to use CLUBB variance in microphysics. 

. CHEMISTRY
  . Refactored chemistry preprocessor to be more robust.
  . Reduce log file lengths by restrict message logging to masterproc in many of
    the chemistry modules
  . Call endrun when lower boundary conditions are specified in more than one 
    manner via bndtvghg, flbc_file, or *vmr namelist variables.  This prevents 
    multiple specification of lower boundary conditions
  . Replace chemistry package trop_strat_bam_v1 with trop_strat_soa
  . Update chemistry in packages:
      trop_mozart_mam3
      trop_mozart_mam7
      trop_mozart_soa
      trop_strat_mam3
      trop_strat_mam7
      super_fast_llnl_mam3
      super_fast_llnl_mam3_linoz
  . Changed default IC file for trop_strat_mam7 chemistry
  . SO2 forcing is no longer automatically added for waccm_mozart_sulfur.
  . Corrections to surface area calculations of modal aerosols.
  . Correction to units of the SOA*_PROD diagnostics.
  . Update to MEGAN factors, solar protons, SAD, and sulfate input file.
  . Update to photolysis cross sections.
  . Updates to master wet and dry dep species lists.
  . Zero out tropospheric sulfate above tropopause and stratospheric sulfate 
    below the tropopause.
  . Deposition velocity of EOOH mapped to CH2O.
  . Change history output of SOA* aerosols from VMR to MMR.
  . Add build-namelist use case for MOZSOA compset so that 'NEU' wet deposition 
    scheme is used.
  . Avoid index out of range error when index is greater the number of 
    registered constituents which can occur when we have chemical tracers that 
    are not registered (e.g., H2O in WACCM).
  . Map SOG species to H2O2.

. Prescribed Modal Aerosols
  . This new functionality (enabled with the "-chem none" argument to
    configure) has limited support.  Datasets have been produced for 1850
    and 2000 climatologies at 2 degree resolution.  There are currently no
    20th century transient datasets.  The 2 degree datasets will be
    automatically interpolated to other spatial resolutions, but we expect
    that the model with cam5 physics will be much more sensitive to
    interpolating the aerosols than the cam4 physics is to interpolating
    the bulk aerosols.

. Improvements to Diagnostic Radiation Calculations
  . Removed restriction that radiation diagnostic calculations reuse the water
    uptake and wet radius values calculated for the climate affecting modes.
    These quantities are now recomputed for the diagnostic modes.

. New MG1.5 microphysics
  . Added new microphysics scheme 'mg1.5', the next development version of the 
    Morrison & Gettelman stratiform cloud microphysics.  
  . Added new mg1.5 option to -microphys configure option.  "mg" is preserved as
    an alias for the old microphysics (which is now "mg1").
  . Added micro_mg_version and micro_mg_sub_version to represent the version 
    number of MG.
  . Set 1.9x2.5 MG1.5 defaults for cldfrc_rhminl and uwshcu_rpen.

. WACCM
  . Added new support for WACCM-SE.
  . Removed unused FV-specific dependencies from qbo.F90.  QBO forcing does not
    currently work with SE, but removing these dependencies is necessary for the
    module to be compiled in a SE case.
  . Added IC file for WACCM5 at 4x5 resolution
  . Removed some "#ifdef WACCM_PHYS" in cases where it can be replaced with a 
    cheap runtime conditional, "if (do_waccm_phys)".
  . Use state%uzm directly instead of requiring it as a separate argument to 
    qbo_relax, and check that it is allocated first.
  . Add "clim_modal_aero_top_press", default 1.e-4 Pa the new top level for 
    modal aerosol microphysics. By default this is high enough that modal 
    aerosol calculations are done throughout the WACCM levels, but below most 
    WACCM-X levels.  Changed top level from trop_cloud_top_lev to 
    clim_modal_aero_top_lev, force MAM top to be above the cloud top
  . Make treatment of WACCM4 and WACCM5 more consistent. Both now set the same 
    top_lev limiter, but some modules perform additional checks for CAM5 
    features to decide if they want to use it.
  . Prevent divide by 0 if wind happens to be exactly 0 at certain points in 
    WACCM's gw_drag.F90.
  . Prevent segfault in gw_drag.F90 from certain bad winds by avoiding use of 
    "abs" to limit integer indices. This is just to avoid a "red herring" crash
    in gw_drag, when the real problem is elsewhere.
  . Changed sim_year for waccmx_1996_cam4 changed to 2000.  Set so2_emis_file 
    for sd_waccm use_cases.
  . Remove deprecated waccm_mozart_v1 chemistry package. The new default is
    waccm_mozart.
  . Set defaults for nspltvrm, nspltac and nsplit when waccm_phys is used
  . Set default srf_emis_cycle_yr to 2000 for waccm_mozart_mam3 chemistry
  . Updated solar_data_file and solar_parms_file input files for SD-WACCM
  . Added default IC file for waccm5 at 4x5 resolution.
  . Added workaround for OpenMP problem for SC-WACCM in tracer_data.F90 when 
    compiled with intel compiler (yellowstone)

. SCAM
   . SCAM use_case arm95_scam has been deprecated by scam_arm95.
   . Added new SCAM use_cases to support new IOP datasets. 
      scam_arm95
      scam_arm97
      scam_gateIII
      scam_twp06
      scam_togaII
      scam_sparticus
      scam_mpace
   . Fixed SCAM date bug.

. USE_CASES
  . Added new use_case 1850-PD_cam5. This is similar to
    1850-2005_cam5 but has data from both observations and
    projections, to allow cases to be run longer.
  . Update fincl1 output variables for the following use_cases
      2000_cam5_trop_moz_mam3
      2000_cam4_trop_strat_soa
      2000_cam5_trop_strat_mam3
      2000_cam5_trop_strat_mam7
      soa_chem_megan_emis
  . Set so2_emis_file
      sd_waccm_geos5
      sd_waccm_tslt_geos5
  . Changed sim_year from 1996 to 2000
      waccmx_1996_cam4
  . Added new use_cases for SD_WACCM sulfur and nuclear winter compsets.
      sd_waccm_sulfur
      waccm_cam4_nuclear_winter
  . Added new use case for prescribed modal aerosol model
      1850_cam5_pm
  . Added new chemistry use_cases
      2000_cam5_trop_moz_mam3
      2000_cam4_trop_strat_soa
      2000_cam5_trop_strat_mam3
      2000_cam5_trop_strat_mam7
  . Removed redundant specification bndtvghg and updated SPE file
      waccm_1955-2005_cam4
      waccm_2005-2100_cam4_rcp85
      waccm_1850-2005_cam4
      waccm_2005-2100_cam4_rcp26
      waccm_2005-2100_cam4_rcp45
      1850-2005_cam4_super_fast_llnl
  . Updated megan_factors_file, corrected emission files, set 
    megan_mapping_emisfctrs to .false., created fincl1 list, and added IC files.
      mozart_megan_emis
      soa_chem_megan_emis
  . Updated IC files, specify defaults for when fv, new datasets for ne30np4,
    fix default parameters for ne120np4
      waccm_2000_cam4
      waccm_sc_2000_cam4
  . SO2 forcing is no longer automatically added for waccm_mozart_sulfur.

CAM INFRASTRUCTURE CHANGES
=============================

. History Output

  . The strategy for defining the fields that appear in the history output
    by default has changed.  A new set of namelist setable variables have
    been defined (see next bullet) and all calls to add_default in the code
    are placed inside a conditional block using one (or more) of these
    variables.  This allows much more control over defining the default
    output.  Modification of the defaults by the fincl* and fexcl* namelist
    variables is still supported.  The current default output is much
    smaller than for previous model versions and contains just the fields
    needed by the AMWG diagnostics package.

  . Namelist variables added to control history file output:
     history_amwg          Switch for diagnostic output of AMWG diag package 
                           variables default:.true.
     history_aerosol       Switch for diagnostic output of the aerosol 
                           tendencies default:.false.
     history_aero_optics   Switch for diagnostic output of the aerosol optics 
                           default:.false.
     history_budget        Switch for cam4 T/Q budget diagnostic output 
                           default:.false.
     history_eddy          Switch for diagnostic output of eddy variables 
                           default:.false.

  . New diagnostics variables for aerosol burdens and wind speeds were added.
  . Removed SRFRAD, and LCLOUD.  
  . Removed unneeded SFRAD from monthly average outputs. Bugzilla #1618

. Introduced dynamically allocated physics state/tend/ptend objects.  The
  driver for this change was to be able to reuse these objects in our
  development of physics parameterization subcolumn capabilities (see
  bullet below).

. Improve debugging capabilities
  . Added a routine to validate physics_state objects, and provide a namelist 
    option(state_debug_checks) to run this routine every time physics_update is 
    called.  state_debug_checks default is .true. for cases passing "-debug" to 
    configure, .false. otherwise.

. Refactor wv_saturation and modify the physics parameterizations to call
  the new set of interfaces for water/ice saturation properties.
   . Consolidate routines in wv_saturation.
   . Pull in related logic from other modules to wv_saturation.
   . Create wv_sat_methods to hold SVP estimation methods separately from 
     interface logic.
         - Completely refactored. A list of public routines:
           - Control routines, replacing esinti and other CAM logic:
             - wv_sat_readnl
             - wv_sat_init
             - wv_sat_final
           - SVP calculations, replacing polysvp:
             - svp_water
             - svp_ice
           - SVP table lookup, largely unchanged:
             - estblf
           - SVP to saturation specific humidity conversion:
             - svp_to_qsat
           - SVP to saturation mass mixing ratio conversion:
             - svp_to_qmmr
           - Saturation specific humidity functions, replacing all subroutines 
             of the form [a,v]qsat[d[2]][_single]
             - qsat
             - qsat_water
             - qsat_ice
           - Wet bulb temperature solver, replacing findsp[_water]:
             - findsp_vc
           - Saturation MMR over dry air (deprecated):
             - qmmr 
   . Update calculation of dqsdt in cldwat.F90 to use new code (and remove check 
     for low pressure that is now done in wv_sat_methods).

. Subcolumn development (This is an ongoing project and is not complete in
  this release) 
  . Introduced new configure parameter "psubcols".  Default is 1 = no subcolumns
  . Introduced use_subcol_microp - Switch which will be used to control
    sub-columns within microphysics.  Namelist flag is accessed in phys_control,
    but it is not used inside CAM yet.
  . state now has additional fields:
      . ngrdcol       -- Grid        -- number of active columns (on the grid).
      . nsubcol(pcols)-- Subcolumns  -- number of active subcolumns in each
                                        grid column
      . psetcols      --             -- max number of columns set - if
                                        subcols = pcols*psubcols, else = pcols
      . ncol          --             -- sum of nsubcol for all ngrdcols - 
                                        number of active columns
      . indcol(pcols*psubcols)       -- indices for mapping from subcols to
                                        grid cols
  . ptend and tend now has additional field:
      . psetcols      --             -- max number of columns set - if
                                         subcols = pcols*psubcols, else = pcols
  . Added new routine physics_ptend_copy_subcol - copies ptend on grid to ptend
    on subcols

Code cleanup and refactoring:
=============================

. Improved how CAM standalone build handles NetCDF.  Improved error handling
  for configure's use of the nf-config and nc-config scripts to determine
  the link arguments.  Also made mods to allow the user to *not* specify
  NetCDF include file or library locations.  This is useful for working
  with compiler wrapper scripts that already have this information from the
  system module settings (e.g., when using the mpif90 wrapper script on
  yellowstone).

. In physpkg.F90, added QNEG3 call after clybry_fam_adj call before QNEG3, so
  that QNEG3 enforces the qmin limit on the result, and the subsequent call to
  physics_state_check can pass.

. "endrun" is now a wrapper for "shr_sys_abort" from csm_share. This means that
  ENDRUN will no longer be printed to log files; ERROR will be printed instead.

. Simplify some constituent limiters in physics_update.

. Changed how solar namelist defaults are set so that for cam5 physics the
  defaults don't depend on which chemistry package is used.  The default
  for the solar data namelist variables was being set differently for the
  configurations "-phys cam5 -chem trop_mam3" and "-phys cam5 -chem none".
  This was changed to make the value for prescribed aerosols be the same as
  for prognostic aerosols.  Also added a check to build-namelist to
  disallow setting both solar_const and solar_data_file.  It only makes
  sense to set one of these variables.  The defaults for cam4 physics
  continue to depend on whether chemistry is used or not.

. cldwat2m_macro: Rename "qsat" to "qs" to avoid confusion with wv_saturation 
  intrinsic (and "esat" to "es" to match).

. Microphysics/macrophysics modules: Change indexes to ensure that output 
  variables do not contain uninitialized data above top_lev.

. Because cldwat_fice is shared code between CAM4 and CAM5, it has been moved to
  cloud_fraction. The resulting code is only used by RK microphysics and thus no
  longer checks microp_scheme.

. Move "tend" argument to the end of every physics_update call, "tend" is now
  an optional argument.  This eliminates the need to declare a dummy "tend"
  variable when the update is to a local copy of the physics state.

. Eliminated MODAL_AERO ifdef and replaced with rad_constituent interface inside
  ndrop.F90.

Bugs fixed:
===========

. Fix units in history output:
  - For mixing ratios and fluxes of number concentrations incorrect units
    of "kg/kg" and "kg/m2/s" have been changed to "1/kg" and "1/m2/s"
  - Output SOA aerosol species in units of kg/kg

. Fix memory leak for WACCM-SE.

. OMP bug fix for WACCM-X in dp_coupling.F90.

. Fixed long name for SNOWHICE.  Bugzilla #945

. Fix memory leak in cam_pio_utils.F90.  Bugzilla #1629

. Bug fix to pbuf_set_field in short_lived species.F90

. Added an endrun call if the FV dycore's vertical levels cross.  This
  prevents some unstable runs in various FV CAM and WACCM simulations.

. Fix saturation vapor pressure calculation for low pressure and/or very high
  temperatures.

. Remove incorrect declaration of intrinsic erfc function in
  modal_aero_rename.F90 and use version from shr_spfn_mod.

. Fix addfld call for EMIS.  Change number of levels from 1 to plev, and changed
  default averaging from 'I' to 'A'

. Modified the Makefile rules used by configure's -test option so they work with
  the recent changes to build MCT as a separate lib.  

. Fix outstanding problems with WACCM5 that cause it to crash, by enforcing
  trop_cloud_top_lev in more modules that require this limit.

. Corrections to prescribed ozone input for SC-WACCM.
